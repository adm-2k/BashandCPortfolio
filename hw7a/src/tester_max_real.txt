My investigation for the final module of “Perspectives in Mathematics” has to do with the intersection between large language models (LLMs) and topology. In a recent paper by a Columbia alumnus, Dr. Stephen Fitz, and his colleagues, the research team based out of Japan attempts to develop new modes of analyzing the internal representations of LLMs through topological data analysis, particularly through a measure of “topological complexity” they name “perforation.”1 Fitz et al.’s investigation is motivated by a general need for more robust modes of analysis when comparing large language models. While his hypotheses and initial investigations are quite novel and require further research to prove their greater validity, Fitz et al.’s paper on “Hidden holes” provides a decent overview of recent developments in both machine learning and topological data analysis in relation to his larger project. The point of taking a topological approach to studying LLMs is to explore a paradigm alternative hello I need just two
